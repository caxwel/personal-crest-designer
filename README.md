## THE HARDEST PART ABOUT RECEIVING NEW ARMOR
## IS DECIDING WHAT ON EARTH TO PAINT ON IT
*...am I right, fellow knights?*

Lucky for you, one member of your favorite team of mages at Code Chrysalis has created a:
# PERSONAL CREST DESIGNER
### time to get painting!
Using simple but historically accurate heraldic imagery, use mysterious word association to find the...
- [⚔︎] tincture (color)
- [⚔︎] ordinary (division of colors)
- [⚔︎] charge (animal/image)

...that's right for you and your personal fighting style.

I'm not planning on breaking character any time soon, so here's how you and your battalion can get started.

## INSTALLATION
1. Install dependencies. Easy enough!
```
yarn
```
2. Investigate
```
yarn serve
```

This app/generator is entirely frontend, so you'll find setup takes very little effort.

## DEPLOYED
Check this out on Heroku!

```

## RESOURCES USED
- Vue
- Bootstrap-vue
- HTML5 Canvas
- Google fonts for the aesthetic

## RECOMMENDATIONS
Don't think too hard about the questions! The first thing that comes to mind is what's meant to be, I'm sure.
